# Repo RTC (Remote Trolling Command)

A Bepinex mod that allows you to input commands on the ingame chat (so you can feel like a real hacker) to spice up your game experience by becoming the hidden, guiding hand that turns the drama and mayhem of emergent gameplay into absolute cinema.

It uses RPC calls from your game client to perform the actions on the other players' clients therefore only \*YOU* need to have the mod installed.

## How to install
1. Install Bepinex if you haven't already
2. Slap the dll on the "plugins" folder
3. There's no step 3 you're ready to go


## Available commands
/s [player] [message] ->  [player] speak [message] with regular voice<br/>
/w [player] [message] ->  [player] speak [message] with crouched voice<br/>
/q [player] -> force  [player] to tumble (q)<br/>
/t [player] [message] -> truck chat [message] as [player]<br/>
/t [message] -> truck chat [message] as Taxman<br/>
/f [player] [x,y,z] -> add impulse in [x,y,z]<br/>
/c [player] [color] -> change [player]'s color to [color] (0-35 same order as the menu)<br/>
/r [player] -> revive [player]<br/>
/l [player] [intensity] -> change [player]'s flash light intensity (only after all extractions are complete)<br/>
/g [player] -> cause [player]'s screen to glitch shortly (like triggering a valuable/spotting a monster)<br/>

You have to type the exact nickname of the player but you don't need to match case. 

Become the god of little trolling
Be **resposible** and have fun!
